Demand Side Management optimizer software

There are seven folders (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3, Case_4, Complex_case, 
Real_case_1, and Real_case_2), which contain all the simulations in this article.
Where,

- Case_1 --> 3.2 Energy production is equal to energy demand without overlap
- Case_2 --> 3.3 Energy production is equal to energy demand with overlap
- Case_3 --> 3.4 Energy production below energy demand with overlap
- Case_4 --> 3.5 Energy production higher than energy demand
- Case_5 --> 3.6 Complex case
- Case_6 --> 3.7.1 Real case 1
- Case_7 --> 3.7.2 Real case 2

In each of the folders there is a file 'Optimizar_poligonos.m', which should be executed. The
rest of the files are functions that will allow solving this methodology.
